For a public blog focused on SEO and making money from Google AdSense, requiring users to log in is counterproductive for three main reasons:

   1. It Creates Friction and Kills Traffic: The primary goal of your blog is to attract as many readers as possible. A login wall is a huge barrier. Most people who discover
       your article through a Google search or a social media link will not bother to create an account. They will simply leave, and you lose that reader forever.

   2. It's Terrible for SEO: Google's bots need to be able to crawl and index your content freely. If your articles are hidden behind a login page, Google can't see them, and
       they will not be ranked in search results. Furthermore, if users click your link on Google and immediately leave because of the login wall (a "bounce"), it signals to
      Google that your page is not a good result, which can harm your rankings.

   3. It Destroys AdSense Potential: The AdSense model relies on a high volume of page views. More readers mean more ad impressions, which means more revenue. By blocking the
       vast majority of potential readers, you are severely limiting the number of people who will ever see your ads.

  Think of your blog as a public park or a retail store. You want the doors to be wide open so anyone can wander in. Requiring a login is like locking the front door and
  asking every potential visitor to fill out a form before they can even look inside.

  The only time you would require a login is for specific, secondary features, such as:
   * Leaving comments (to prevent spam).
   * Accessing premium, members-only content (if you have a subscription model).
   * You, the administrator, logging into the backend to write and manage posts.

  For general readers, access should always be open and immediate.
