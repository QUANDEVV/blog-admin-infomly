if i work harder and considering my videos are in s3 bucket and cloudfront ,,,optimised next.js withswr instead of useffects and the rest lets say if i work harder how 
  much do you think i can earn monthly by adsense in first 6 months be honest lets say i follow best practises

✦ That's the million-dollar question, and the honest answer is: it is impossible to predict a specific income. Anyone who gives you a definite number is guessing.

  However, I can give you a realistic, honest breakdown of the factors involved and what you should expect in the first 6 months.

  Think of your earnings as a formula: Earnings = Traffic × RPM

   * Traffic: The number of people who visit your site.
   * RPM (Revenue Per 1,000 Impressions): The amount of money you earn for every 1,000 page views. This is the magic number that depends on your niche, audience, and ad
     placement.

  Let's break down the factors based on your situation:

  Factors in Your Favor (What Boosts Your RPM)

   1. Your Niche is High-Value: This is your biggest advantage. Your topics (AI, GPUs, Software Development) are what advertisers pay a premium for. The "Cost Per Click"
      (CPC) on ads related to technology and finance is much higher than in niches like recipes or celebrity gossip. This means your RPM will likely be higher than average.
   2. Optimized Site: A fast, well-structured Next.js site with good ad placements (as we've discussed) will lead to a better user experience and a higher Click-Through Rate
      (CTR) on your ads.

  The Harsh Reality (What Limits Your Traffic)

   1. The "Google Sandbox": For a new website, it takes time for Google to trust you. For the first 3-6 months, you are in an unofficial "sandbox" where your articles will
      struggle to rank, even if they are perfect. This is the biggest hurdle.
   2. Building an Audience Takes Time: Traffic doesn't appear overnight. It requires consistent content creation, promotion, and waiting for your SEO efforts to compound.

  A Realistic 6-Month Timeline

  Forget about specific dollar amounts. Instead, think about these milestones:

   * Months 1-3: The Grind (Expect ~$0 - $20 per month)
       * Your focus is 100% on producing a high volume of excellent content. You need to build a library of articles for Google to start indexing.
       * Your traffic will be minimal, likely just from you, your friends, and maybe a few direct links you share.
       * Your earnings will be negligible. You might make enough to buy a coffee. This is normal. Do not get discouraged.

   * Months 4-6: The First Signs of Life (Expect ~$20 - $100+ per month)
       * If you've been consistent, this is when you might start to see some articles climb out of the sandbox and begin ranking for long-tail keywords.
       * You'll see your first trickles of organic traffic from Google.
       * Your earnings could be enough to buy a few pizzas or pay for your hosting. The actual amount is less important than the upward trend. If your traffic and earnings
         are growing month-over-month, you are on the right track.

  The Honest Bottom Line

  In the first 6 months, do not focus on the money. Focus on the work. Your goal is not to earn a specific amount, but to build the foundation for future earnings.

  Success in the first 6 months looks like this:
   * Publishing 2-4 high-quality articles every week.
   * Seeing your organic traffic in Google Analytics grow, even if it's just from 10 to 100 visitors a day.
   * Achieving your first "Page 1" ranking for a specific, long-tail keyword.

  If you do all the technical things right and work incredibly hard on creating valuable content, you have a strong chance of building a successful, income-generating
  blog. But that success will be measured in years, not months. The first 6 months are just the price of admission.

> wow okay lets say the first 6 months of admission i pass it well consistent good quality content everything check how much do you think i can earn monthly after 6 months

✦ Excellent question. Once you've successfully passed that initial 6-month "admission" phase, the entire dynamic changes. You're no longer just building a foundation; you're
   starting to build upwards.

  This next phase is all about the "Snowball Effect."

  Your first 6 months are like packing a snowball on a hilltop. You're working hard, and the ball is getting bigger, but it's not moving on its own. After 6 months, you
  give it the first big push.

   * Your older articles start to mature and climb the Google rankings.
   * Your website has more "authority" in Google's eyes.
   * New articles get indexed and ranked faster.

  The growth is no longer linear; it starts to compound. So, while I still can't give you a guaranteed number, I can give you realistic, traffic-based scenarios for what
  could happen between months 7 and 18.

  First, let's establish a realistic RPM (Revenue per 1,000 views) for your high-value tech niche. With a good portion of your audience from the US, UK, or Europe, an RPM
  between $15 and $40 is plausible. This is not a guarantee, but a reasonable range for calculation.

  Now, let's look at what that means at different traffic levels you could realistically achieve.

  ---

  Scenario 1: The Emerging Authority (10,000 - 30,000 monthly page views)

  This is a very achievable goal in the 7-12 month range if you continue working hard. You're consistently ranking for some keywords and have a steady trickle of daily
  organic traffic.

   * Calculation: (10,000 views / 1,000) * ($15 to $40 RPM)
   * Potential Monthly Earnings: $150 - $400

  This is often the most exciting stage, as it's the first time you're seeing real, meaningful income that can cover all your costs and then some.

  ---

  Scenario 2: The Serious Side Hustle (50,000 - 100,000 monthly page views)

  This is a fantastic goal for your second year (months 12-24). At this point, you likely have a few articles that rank on the first page of Google for high-traffic
  keywords. Your blog is now a recognized name for certain topics.

   * Calculation: (50,000 views / 1,000) * ($15 to $40 RPM)
   * Potential Monthly Earnings: $750 - $2,000

  This is life-changing income for many people. It's a significant side hustle that can have a real impact on your finances.

  ---

  Scenario 3: The Path to Full-Time (250,000+ monthly page views)

  This is the long-term goal, likely taking 2+ years of dedicated, strategic work. You are now a major authority in your space. You have dozens of articles ranking highly,
   a strong backlink profile, and a loyal audience.

   * Calculation: (250,000 views / 1,000) * ($15 to $40 RPM)
   * Potential Monthly Earnings: $3,750 - $10,000

  At this level, your blog is a legitimate, full-time business.

  The Honest Conclusion

  The key takeaway is that your earnings will be directly tied to the traffic you can attract. Your high-value niche gives you a powerful advantage, making each visitor
  more valuable than in other niches.

  Your focus should be on a simple, powerful goal: How can I create content so good that I can reach 1,000 visitors a day? If you can solve that, the income will take care
   of itself.
